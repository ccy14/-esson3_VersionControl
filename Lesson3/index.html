            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control is a way for people to keep track of the different versions made to a file. This can be done by making new files that have different names, such as changing the date in the name. This method does not work very well when you start to get large amounts of changes or multiple people working on the same files at once. To deal with this, a Version Control System is used. A version control system will keep track of who editied a file, when they edited it, and aid in merging the files in a way that works. It usually does this by creating clones of the files for people to work on, and then allowing them to submit there edited version of the file back to the master.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is one of many version control systems. Git was created in 2005 as a way for people to upload new versions of Linux that they had modified from the kernel. Linux created Git after the old program people used to upload thier versions, BitKeeper, was no longer free to use. When they were creating Git they aimed to make it as fast as possible, have a simple design that was easy to understand, and be fully distributed. Although Git started as way for people to modify Linux, it has become a very useful tool for version control. Git is used by many companies all over the world because it is still incredibly fast and easy to use. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The entire purpose of Git is to make managing the versions of files quick and easy. Git achieves this by using a three stage system. The first stage is the Working Directory. This is when the file if checked out from the main directory and stored on your local disk. From here the file is edited by the user however they want. The next stage is the Stage Area. This is where the files go after you add them. Here they are waiting to be committed to the main git directory. Finally there is the git directory. This is where a snapshot of the files in your staging area are added and will permanently by stored.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Cloning an existing repository is a very useful tool for contributing to projects that have already been started. What cloning a repository does is it will give you all of the versions and data that the repository has rather than just one file. This allows you to see all of the stages that the project has gone through and make edits that will most effectively benefit the project. The way that you clone a repository is by using the command "git clone". After this you will see a new directory that will have all of the project files inside of it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">to the Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">After you have finished editing the files in a project it is time to add them back to the repository where they can be viewed and edited by other people. The first step is to use the command 'git status' to see what state the files are in. This command will also tell you of any untracked files, or files that have not been added to the staging area. To get these files into the staging area the 'git add' command is used. Once all of the files that you want to send back to the main repository are added to the staging are, it is time to commit. To do this you use the 'git commit' command which will upload your edited files back into the main repository. You can also add '-m' to the end of the the commit statement to add a custom message with your commit.</p>
